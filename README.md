# RxLifecycle

This library allows one to automatically complete sequences based on a second lifecycle stream.

This capability is useful in Android, where incomplete subscriptions can cause memory leaks.

## Usage

You must start with an `Observable<T>` representing a lifecycle stream. Then you use `RxLifecycle` to bind
a sequence to that lifecycle.

You can bind when the lifecycle emits anything:

```java
myObservable
    .compose(RxLifecycle.bind(lifecycle))
    .subscribe();
```

Or you can bind to when a specific lifecyle event occurs:

```java
myObservable
    .compose(RxLifecycle.bindUntilEvent(lifecycle, ActivityEvent.DESTROY))
    .subscribe();
```

Alternatively, you can let RxLifecycle determine the appropriate time to end the sequence:

```java
myObservable
    .compose(RxLifecycleAndroid.bindActivity(lifecycle))
    .subscribe();
```

It assumes you want to end the sequence in the opposing lifecycle event - e.g., if subscribing during `START`, it will
terminate on `STOP`. If you subscribe after `PAUSE`, it will terminate at the next destruction event (e.g.,
`PAUSE` will terminate in `STOP`).

## Providers

Where do lifecycles come from? Generally, they are provided by an appropriate `LifecycleProvider<T>`. But where are
those implemented?

You have a few options for that:

1. Use rxlifecycle-components and subclass the provided `RxActivity`, `RxFragment`, etc. classes.
1. Use [Navi](https://github.com/trello/navi/) + rxlifecycle-navi to generate providers.
1. Write the implementation yourself.

If you use rxlifecycle-components, just extend the appropriate class, then use the built-in `bindToLifecycle()` (or `bindUntilEvent()`) methods:

```java
public class MyActivity extends RxActivity {
    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        myObservable
            .compose(bindToLifecycle())
            .subscribe();
    }
}
```

If you use rxlifecycle-navi, then you just pass your `NaviComponent` to `NaviLifecycle` to generate a provider:

```java
public class MyActivity extends NaviActivity {
    private final LifecycleProvider<ActivityEvent> provider
        = NaviLifecycle.createActivityLifecycleProvider(this);

    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        myObservable
            .compose(provider.bindToLifecycle())
            .subscribe();
    }
}
```

## Unsubscription

RxLifecycle does not actually unsubscribe the sequence. Instead it terminates the sequence. The way in which
it does so varies based on the type:

- `Observable`, `Flowable` and `Maybe` - emits `onCompleted()`
- `Single` and `Completable` - emits `onError(CancellationException)`

If a sequence requires the `Subscription.unsubscribe()` behavior, then it is suggested that you manually handle
the `Subscription` yourself and call `unsubscribe()` when appropriate.

## Kotlin

The rxlifecycle-kotlin module provides built-in extensions to the base RxJava types:

```java
myObservable
    .bindToLifecycle(myView)
    .subscribe { }

myObservable
    .bindUntilEvent(myRxActivity, STOP)
    .subscribe { }
```

## Installation

RxLifecycle2 is currently only on OSS snapshot repository (https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/).

```gradle
compile 'com.trello.rxlifecycle2:rxlifecycle:2.0-SNAPSHOT'

// If you want to bind to Android-specific lifecycles
compile 'com.trello.rxlifecycle2:rxlifecycle-android:2.0-SNAPSHOT'

// If you want pre-written Activities and Fragments you can subclass as providers
compile 'com.trello.rxlifecycle2:rxlifecycle-components:2.0-SNAPSHOT'

// If you want to use Navi for providers
compile 'com.trello.rxlifecycle2:rxlifecycle-navi:2.0-SNAPSHOT'

// If you want to use Kotlin syntax
compile 'com.trello.rxlifecycle2:rxlifecycle-kotlin:2.0-SNAPSHOT'
```
