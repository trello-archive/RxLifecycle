# Changelog

## 2.0 (*unreleased*)

This major revision was made to support RxJava 2. RxLifecycle 2.0 lives in a new namespace and package
names so that it can work side-by-side with RxLifecycle 1.0 (while transitioning).

The biggest change is that `LifecycleTransformer` now works for *all* RxJava types:
`Observable`, `Flowable`, `Single`, `Maybe` and `Completable`. Unlike before, there's
no extra steps you have to take to make it work with types other than `Observable`.

- [#167](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/167): Upgrade to RxJava 2
- [#169](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/169): Move to com.trello.rxlifecycle2
- [#170](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/170): Added Maybe support
- [#172](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/172): Added Flowable support

## 1.0 (2016-11-03)

First and (hopefully) final release of 1.x branch!

This release marks the start of maintenance mode for RxJava 1 support. Future work will be devoted to supporting
RxJava 2. Important bugs may be squashed but new features will have to be extraordinarily compelling in order
to be added.

- [#162](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/162): Made all components abstract
- [#157](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/157): Added RxPreferenceFragment

## 0.8.0 (2016-09-19)

- [#152](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/152): Support RxJava 1.2.0.

  This change is not backwards compatible with RxJava 1.1.x, so if you want to continue
  receiving updates for RxLifecycle you will eventually need to upgrade to RxJava 1.2.x.

## 0.7.0 (2016-08-24)

There are a couple major breaking changes in this release, so read carefully.

- [#143](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/143): Split Android parts of rxlifecycle into rxlifecycle-android

  Now the `rxlifecycle` dependency is a pure Java core. To use RxLifecycle with Android, you should also include
  `rxlifecycle-android` as well now.

  `RxLifecycle` methods that are for Android (`bindActivity()`, `bindFragment()` and `bindView()`) are now in
  `RxLifecycleAndroid` (found in the `rxlifecycle-android` artifact).

   Deprecated methods in `RxLifecycle` were removed as well.

- [#138](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/138) / [#139](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/139):
Replace `ActivityLifecycleProvider` and `FragmentLifecycleProvider` with `LifecycleProvider<T>`.

  This means that you need to replace `ActivityLifecycleProvider` with `LifecycleProvider<ActivityEvent>` and
  `FragmentLifecycleProvider` with `LifecycleProvider<FragmentEvent>`.

Other changes:

- [#140](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/140): Fixed type inference for LifecycleTransformer.forSingle()
- [#135](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/135): Add Kotlin extensions for Singles and Completables

## 0.6.1 (2016-05-11)

- [#118](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/118): Use `LifecycleTransformer` in the provider interfaces

## 0.6.0 (2016-05-06)

- Added `LifecycleTransformer`, which provides `Single` and `Completable` support.
- [#111](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/111): Added component support for `AppCompatDialogFragment`
- [#107](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/107): Fixed navi component package

## 0.5.0 (2016-02-27)

There are a few methods which have been **deprecated** and will be removed in a future release. Each one has a drop-in
replacement (and currently calling the deprecated version just routes to the new one):

* `bindUntilActivityEvent()` and `bindUntilFragmentEvent()` -> `bindUntilEvent()`
* `bindView()` -> `bind()`

The other changes mostly involve opening up the API for more customization:

* [#78](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/78): Added rxlifecycle-kotlin (adds some extensions)
* [#79](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/79): Made bindUntilEvent() public, deprecated more specific calls
* [#82](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/82): Opened up bind() methods for public consumption
* [#83](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/83), [#85](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/85): Added
annotations for better lint checking
* [#88](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/88): Use `.equals()` instead of == for event comparison (for
custom event support with the newly opened-up `bind()`)
* [#89](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/89): Make OutsideLifecycleException public (for anyone who wants
to write their own `bind()` implementations)

## 0.4.0 (2015-12-10)

* [#62](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/62), [#67](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/67): Added
[Navi](https://github.com/trello/navi/)-based implementation of providers.
* [#61](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/61): Moved `ActivityLifecycleProvider` and
`FragmentLifecycleProvider` into the core library so that multiple implementations can share them easily. The package
 name changed so you may need to re-import them in your code.
* [#60](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/60): Reverted generic parameters back to `Transformer<T, T>`

## 0.3.1 (2015-11-27)

* [#46](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/46): Updated generic parameters of `Transformer<T, T>` to support Kotlin type inference.

## 0.3.0

* [#12](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/12): Added `RxLifecycle.bindView()`. This allows binding a
`Subscription` until a `View` detaches itself from the window.
* [#30](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/30): Calling `bindActivity()` or `bindFragment()` outside of the
lifecycle causes the sequence to immediately complete (instead of throwing an error).
* [#31](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/31): Passing nulls to RxLifecycle now always immediately throws an
exception.

## 0.2.0

* [#14](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/14): Use takeUntil internally (instead of a faulty custom operator)

    While this fixes some intractable problems that could occur with the old system, it also includes a major behavior
    change: when the bind decides to stop subscribing, it calls `onCompleted` (whereas before it would just
    unsubscribe).

    When upgrading, you should check that your usages of `onCompleted` (either in `subscribe()`, `doOnCompleted()`,
    or `doOnTerminate()`) can handle the sequence ending due to the lifecycle bind.

    If you still need the old behavior in some spots, you should handle the `Subscription` yourself manually (and call
    `unsubscribe()` when appropriate).

* [#16](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle/pull/16): Lowered minSdkVersion to 14

## 0.1.0

Initial independent release (split from RxAndroid 0.25.0)

* Added support for AppCompatActivity via `RxAppCompatActivity`
* Components (e.g. `RxActivity`) now support `bindUntilEvent()` and `bindToLifecycle()`, which avoids having to deal with the lifecycle `Observable` directly.

### Differences from RxAndroid 0.25

* Renamed `LifecycleObservable` to `RxLifecycle`
* Switched from wrapping `Observables` to using `Transformer` + `compose()` (which allows for chaining)
* Split `LifecycleEvent` into two parts - `ActivityEvent` and `FragmentEvent`, in order to prevent easy mixups that could occur before
* Split `bindUntilLifecycleEvent()` into `bindUntilFragmentEvent()` and `bindUntilActivityEvent()`
* Renamed `bindFragmentLifecycle()` to `bindFragment()`
* Renamed `bindActivityLifecycle()` to `bindActivity()`
